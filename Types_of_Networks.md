<h3>Computer networks are geographically divided into many groups according to their size. There may be large networks with millions of devices in them and small networks consisting of 2-3 devices. The following image shows some types of computer networks by size.</h3>

# Personal Area Network (PAN)

<p>Personal Area Network (PAN) refers to networks with a minimal and small number of devices that cover very short distances (for example, up to 10 meters). For example, a mobile device and a wireless headset connected via Bluetooth are examples of this type of network. There are only 2 devices in this small network: A mobile device and a wireless headset.</p>

# Local Area Network (LAN)

<p>Local Area Network (LAN) has a larger area than PAN. The number of devices in it can be much more. It is the most commonly used and found network type. Sometimes a network with 2 devices can also be called a LAN. The fact that it supports much more than 2 devices in terms of capacity and is geographically spread over a wider area indicates that it is a LAN-type network. For example, home networks and shared networks within the building can be given as examples of LAN.</p>

# Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

<p>The Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) is a geographically city-sized computer network in which many LAN computer networks are interconnected. It connects networks with fiber optic cabling.</p>

# Wide Area Network (WAN)
<p>Wide Area Network (WAN) is the computer network with the largest geographical area among computer networks. This computer network is so large that it can even contain continents. It hosts all other computer networks within it. An example of this computer network is the "Internet". The following address can be used to see the intercontinental fiber-optic infrastructures around the world:</p>

# Campus Area Network (CAN)

<p>Campus Area Network (CAN) is a computer network that is geographically smaller than MAN and larger than LAN. This computer network can contain several LANs. Usually, the computer networks of universities, institutions, or private companies are given as an example of this computer network.</p>
