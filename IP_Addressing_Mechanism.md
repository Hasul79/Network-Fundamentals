# IP Addressing Mechanism

<p>While creating TCP/IP computer networks, a logical address (IP Address) must first be assigned to each device in the network. These assignment processes are called "IP Addressing Mechanism". If an IP address is not assigned to a device in the network, it cannot communicate with devices inside or outside the network.</p>
