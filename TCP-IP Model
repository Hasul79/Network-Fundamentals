# TCP/IP Model

<p>The TCP/IP model was designed and developed by the Department of Defense (DoD) in the 1960s. When the TCP/IP model was introduced, there was no model that set the standards in computer network communication yet. With this model, it was determined how the network communication should be on the basis of the internet. The TCP/IP model has a layered architecture and consists of 4 layers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Application Layer</li>
<li>Transport Layer</li>
<li>Internet Layer</li>
<li>Network Access Layer</li>
</ul>

<br/>



# Network Access Layer
<p>The network access layer is the 1st layer in the TCP/IP model. It corresponds to layers 1 and 2 in the OSI reference model. This layer includes physical accesses and hardware controls.</p>
# Internet Layer
<p>The Internet layer is the 2nd layer in the TCP/IP model. It has similar functions as layer 3 in the OSI reference model. In this layer, network communication functions are performed by logical addressing.</p>
# Transport Layer
<p>The transport layer is the 3rd layer in TCP/IP model. It has similar functions as layer 4 in the OSI reference model. In this layer, data transmission is made and the reliability of the communication is ensured. Whether the data is transmitted correctly without corruption is managed in this layer.</p>
# Application Layer
<p>The Application layer is the 4th and final layer in the TCP/IP model. It is a layer that covers all the operations performed in layers 5, 6, and 7 in the OSI reference model. Application-level controls and operations are executed in this layer.</p>
# OSI Model vs. TCP/IP Model
<p>Although the OSI reference model and the TCP/IP model are very similar models, they differ from each other on some points. When the TCP/IP model first emerged, it emerged out of necessity, not aiming to be a standard. The OSI reference model, on the other hand, aimed to design the ideal network communication, which should be in theory, including its practical use. The TCP/IP model was developed based on some protocols. The OSI model, on the other hand, was not developed on any protocol.</p>
